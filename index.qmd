## BIO

My name is Sreekanya Peddireddi and I'm doing masters in Advanced Data Analytics and This will be my final semester and hoping to complete the course this semester. I completed my bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering and worked in IT for 6 years. The reason I chose this course is that most of my IT experience is related to banking domain and where I deal with large amounts of data, and that is where I realized that I needed to improve my data analytics skills in order to advance in my professional life, and that definitely required some additional learning, so here I am, eager to learn more and grow. I feel that my ambition, hard work, and integrity will propel me to professional success. I also believe in collaboration, which I feel will serve as a stepping stone in my professional career. As an avid enthusiast of a healthy and active lifestyle, I consider exercise an integral part of my daily routine and I like spending my time in gardening and I do play badminton.
